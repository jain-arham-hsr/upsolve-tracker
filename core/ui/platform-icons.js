/**
 * Small inline marks for each platform, used wherever a row needs to say which
 * site it came from.
 *
 * Drawn rather than bundled, but **taken from each site's actual mark** rather
 * than invented — checking the real favicons is what fixed these:
 *
 *  - **Codeforces** — its three bars, yellow/blue/red with blue tallest,
 *    which is exactly what its favicon shows.
 *  - **AtCoder** — the shield from its heraldic crest. The full crest is a
 *    shield and globe flanked by two horses over a wordmark; only the shield
 *    silhouette survives being shrunk, and it is the distinctive part.
 *  - **CodeChef** — `CC` on brown, which *is* its favicon, in its own colours
 *    (`#583722` / `#FAFAED`, sampled from it). A toque was drawn three times
 *    and read as a cloud, then a muffin, then a mushroom: at 12px a lobed
 *    crown over a band is food, whatever the intent.
 *
 * **12px is the design constraint, not an afterthought**, and vectors flatter
 * themselves at 96px. Rasterise at the real size and magnify the pixels before
 * believing a mark works — that is what caught the `@` tried for AtCoder,
 * which is handsome large and a blob small.
 *
 * Light-on-dark marks are inverted from their sites' branding, because a dark
 * mark on the #1e1e1e panel is close to invisible.
 *
 * Inline SVG rather than image files so they inherit the panel's rendering and
 * cost no extra request.
